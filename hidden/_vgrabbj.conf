; This is an example config file for the vgrabbj video grabber
;
; All values in here represent the defaults of vgrabbj if called without
; any config-file, so modifying these values is equal with adding an
; option on the command line.
; Except one: ftp. The ftp-code does not work on the command line, because
; this would expose the password for the ftp-server to the command ps.
; The password would be readable for every user on that machine and we don't
; want that.
;
; So, go ahead, check the values and place something meaningful in here.
;
Brightness 	Off
;	Brightness adjustment to be performed by vgrabbj, default Off
;	if set to off, image from cam is taken without adjustment
;	If you set this to On, the input has to be handled as RGB24 and
;	via normal read(). To enable this, you might need to set ForcePalette
;	to 4 (for RGB24). Without, it might not work (depends on your cam's
;	default palette).
DebugLevel	4
;	Valid Debuglevels are between 0 and 7, with 7 babbling all the time,
;	0 saying nothing; defaults to 4
ImageQuality 	75
;	Quality setting for jpeg image; default 75
SetImageSize	On
;	To turn off imagesize setting of vgrabbj, needed for some webcams
; 	default On
ImageSize	vga
;	Imagesize can be sqcif|qsif|qcif|sif|cif|vga|svga|xga|sxga|uxga;
;	default cif, being:
;	sqcif	128x96
;       qsif	160x120
;	qcif	176x144
;	sif	320x240
;	cif	352x288
;	vga	640x480
;	svga	800x600
;	xga	1024x768
;	sxga	1280x1024
;	uxga	1600x1200
; ImageWidth    640
; ImageHeight   480
;	BE CAREFUL! These values are not checked if valid!
;	They supersede any ImageSize defined in here, only
;	commandline arguments have higher priority; no defaults
SwitchColor	Off
;	If your output has red and green swapped, turn this switch
;	it swaps red and green; default: Off
SwitchRL	Off
;	If you would like to get a mirrored image (left-right), turn
;	this switch on; default: Off
NoUseMmap	Off
;	Set to yes if your cam cannot do RGB24 and cannot use mmap'ed
;	memory. Rarely needed. If you don't know what I'm talking about,
;	leave at default: Off
;DiscardFrames  0
;	You can discard x frames before the actual picture is taken
;	This might be helpful if your image is over- or underexposed
;	(too bright/dark). vgrabbj tries to force the cam to adjust
;	its exposure setting via multiple reads (only if mmap'ed
;	transfer is possible on your cam - if your cam can't do this,
;	the option is silently ignored).
;	This costs a lot of time because x images are fully read before
;	vgrabbj continues.
;ForcePalette	0
;	Force vgrabbj to use the specified palette; if that one is
;	not supported by your driver, vgrabbj falls back to a
;	supported one, therefor its just the first "try" on the device
;	default order is: RGB24, RGB32, YUYV (which is here equal to YUV422),
;	YUV420, YUV420P
;
;	Being (from /usr/include/linux/videodev.h):
;	1	VIDEO_PALETTE_GREY				not supported
;	2	VIDEO_PALETTE_HI240				not supported
;	3	VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB565				not supported
;	4	VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB24
;	5	VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB32
;	6	VIDEO_PALETTE_RGB555				not supported
;	7	VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV422, VIDEO_PALETTE_COMPONENT
;	8	VIDEO_PALETTE_YUYV
;	9	VIDEO_PALETTE_UYV				not supported	
;	10	VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420
;	11	VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV411				not supported
;	12	VIDEO_PALETTE_RAW				not supported
;	13	VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV422P, VIDEO_PALETTE_PLANAR	not supported
;	14	VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV411P				not supported
;	15	VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420P
;	16	VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV410P				not supported
;
;	You might need to set this to 4 (RGB24) if the brightness adjustment
;	does not seem to work.
OutputFormat	jpg
;	Options are jpg, png, or ppm; default: jpg
OutputFile /var/www/default/random/hidden/_image.jpg
;	Where to write the grabbed image. This file must be read/writeable by
;	the user running vgrabbj; default: /dev/stdout
;	If you don't pipe the output someplace else, this WILL mess up you
;	current console/terminal! Set it to something useful, especially for
;	daemon mode
;Archive /tmp/archive/webcam-%Y-%d-%m-%H-%M-%S.jpg
;       Archive images to strftime formatted filenames. Default: Off
;       This archives the grabbed images to the specified path. The path
;       is first processed with strftime to get the actual filename, see
;       man 3 strftime for details.
;	Be aware: this option might fill your harddrive because there is
;	no upper limit for the archive, yet!!
VideoDevice	/dev/video0
;	Where to get the data from. This device must be read/writeable by the
;	user running vgrabbj
OpenOnce	On
;	OpenOnce set to on lets vgrabbj open the VideoDevice only once after
;	all configuration is checked and closes it only when it ends. Hence,
;	it is a useful option in daemon mode only, if you suspect the 
;	open/close calls on VideoDevice for each image to be a problem with
;	your driver. Be aware, that no other application can use VideoDevice
;	even while vgrabbj sits idling, waiting it defined sleeptime.
;	To avoid memory fragmentation I strongly advise to set it to On.
;	Default: On
Daemon		500000
;	Use vgrabbj in daemon mode, set the sleeptime in microseconds
;	1000000 equals a waiting time of 1 second (!). Daemon 0 (zero) means
;	that daemon mode is disabled (default). With 1 (one) as the smallest
;	value to enable daemon operation, you should be aware that this means
;	you box is under constant load from vgrabbj and the file might not be
;	readable by any other app because it's constantly rewritten!
;	If not set, daemon mode is not enabled (default)
;DaemonSeconds	0
;	Same as Daemon, but value is taken as a value of seconds. Use if you're
;	to lazy to write that many zeros and don't need that fine resolution.
UseTmpOut	On
;	Images taken are written to a temporary file (named /tmp/t<outputfile>)
;	in case <outputfile> is not /dev/stdout. After this is done, the file
;	is copied via system call to the final destination. This tends to 
;	better the situation if the outputfile is read directly by a webserver.
;	If you want to write the image data directly to the destination file,
;	set this switch to Off.
;
;	Timestamping of the image
UseTimeStamp	Off
;	Timestamp the image with a defineable string, default: Off
;	The handling between commandline and configfile is currently different!
;	In the configfile you HAVE TO set this option to On if you want the
;	string in the image. On the commandline, ANY option related to the
;	timestamp feature set on the commandline enables it! So you can safely
;	set all other timestamp values
;;;;;;; CHANGE THIS SETTING AND UNCOMMENT IT TO USE TIMESTAMPING
;  FontFile	/usr/share/fonts/truetype/Arialn.ttf
;	Font to be used for timestamping the image
;	default: /usr/share/fonts/truetype/Arialn.ttf
TimeStamp	"%A, %e. %B %Y - %T"
;	String to be put in the image
;	default: "%a, %e. %B %Y - %T", see man 3 strftime for details
;	being: <short weekday>, <day of month without leading 0>. <month name>
;	<four digit year> - <time in 24h notation>
FontSize	12
;	Fontsize for the string to be put in the image
;	Values may range between 3 and 100, default: 12
Position	upperright
;	Where to put the string in the image. Default: upperright, possible:
;	upperleft	or	UL
;	lowerleft	or	LL
;	uppercenter	or	UC
;	lowercenter	or	LC
;	upperright	or	UR
;	lowerright	or	LR
Blend		60
;	How much of the original picture shall be viewable behind
;	the string? 1 = no string, 100 = no image
BorderSize	2
;	Pixels to border the string (being blended), values may range between
;	1 and 255, default 2
;
;	FTP-settings
EnableFtp	No
;	Do the ftp? ftp is not available on the commandline for one simple
;	reason: if all values were given on the commandline, the password
;	would also be on the commandline, hence every user (!!) on that
;	box could see the password via `ps a`. That's not what we want,
;	therefore, everything has to be done via the config-file.
RemoteHost	ftp.foo.bar
;	What's the address of the ftp host (name or ip address)
RemoteDir	/
;	Where on the remote box to put the image
RemoteImageName	camimage.jpg
;	Name of the image on the remote box
Username	foo
;	Username to log into the remote box
Password	bar
;	Password to log into the remote box (WARNING: cleartext transmission!
;	NO protection against sniffers!!!!)
KeepAlive 	Off
;	When set to On this option keeps the ftp connection alive; default: Off
TryHarder	2
;	If the remote box is not as helpful as expected, possible:
;	not implemented, yet
Passive		Off
; 	When set to On, use passive ftp. Default: Off
;
